OBSERVATION 1:
During test 1, when DNS recieved a query, I tried sending back the following response:
    
    serverSocket.sendto(b'Sup Mate?', address)
    Because send to doesn't take regular strings but string of bytes so put b before string.

But the nslookup on the client side didn't recognize it and keeps sending back the query messages, which gives me the idea that
nslookup ignores any response other than the DNS query answer.
